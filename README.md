# Inverse design of photonic crystal cavities

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python functions and Jupyter notebooks designed to extend the capabilities of the [Legume](https://github.com/fancompute/legume) package. These tools are specifically tailored for L3 photonic cavity simulations and gradient-based optimization.

## Features
- Guided Mode Expansion (GME) simulation of L3 cavity mode using Legume
- Simultaneous optimization of quality factor and collecting efficiency of L3 photonic crystal cavity
- Functions to calculate and visualize farfield of photonic crystal cavities
- Example Jupyter notebooks demonstrating code usage.

## Requirements
This project depends on the Legume package. You can install it by following their [installation guide](https://github.com/fancompute/legume#installation).

## Usage
1. Install Legume if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/fancompute/legume.git
   ```
2. Explore the Jupyter notebooks `GME_L3_cavity_simulation.ipynb` and `Optimize_L3_cavity.ipynb` to understand the codebase.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or additional features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments
This project builds on the [Legume](https://github.com/fancompute/legume) package.
